**Game Mechanics**

**1.User Input:** The player selects one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. 

**2.Computer's Choice:** The computer generates a random selection from rock, paper, or scissors. 

**3.Outcome Determination:** A series of conditional statements (if/elif/else) in the code compare the two choices to determine the winner based on these rules:

**o** Rock beats scissors: (Rock wins). 

**o** Scissors beats paper: (Scissors wins). 

**o** Paper beats rock: (Paper wins). 

**o** If both players choose the same option, it's a tie. 



**Programming Implementation**

**Randomness:** Programming languages often use a random module to make the computer's choice unpredictable and fair, simulating a random outcome. 

**User Interface:** The game can be a simple text-based console application or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter, which displays choices and results. 

**Logic:** The core game logic relies on conditional statements to compare the player's input and the computer's random choice to declare a winner or a tie.
